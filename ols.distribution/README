OpenBench LogicSniffer Client
=============================

This is the client software for the OpenBench LogicSniffer (short name: ols) 
written by J.W. Janssen.

Based on the original Sump code base, this project aims at making the client
more user-friendly, better to extend dynamically and better user experience.

For more information about the hardware and software, see <http://ols.lxtreme.nl>
and <http://dangerousprototypes.com/open-logic-sniffer>.

Drop me a line if you want to contribute code to the OLS repository, or need 
any other form of help with this client.
