OpenBench LogicSniffer repository

This is the public GIT repository for the OpenBench LogicSniffer (short name:
ols) written by J.W. Janssen.

For more information about this software, see <http://ols.lxtreme.nl> and
<http://dangerousprototypes.com/open-logic-sniffer>.

== COMPILING THE SOURCES ==

In case you're interested in cloning this repository and compile it yourself,
you should do the following:

  $ git clone http://github.com/jawi/ols.git

For compiling the sources, you need to have at least a valid JDK (1.6+) and
Ant 1.8+ installed. For developing, I can recommend Eclipse as development
environment.

  $ cd ols/build
  $ ant build package

After this, you should find the latest binary ZIP or tarball in
"build/generated".

== DEVELOPING FOR OLS ==

Developing for OLS can be done with any "modern" IDE, like Eclipse, Netbeans,
or even Emacs. However, using Eclipse will be the easiest, especially with
the Bndtools plugin installed (see [1], or Eclipse Marketplace).

Drop me a line if you want to contribute code to the OLS repository, if needed
I can give you write-access to the GitHub or apply your patch.
